The overall concept:

1. How to setup your RPi4, out of the box, for MQTT in your house.

1. How to hack a Particle.io (as an exemplar) to become an MQTT publisher to your local RPi4

1. How to set up Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/)  so you have a back door into the RPi from anywhere on earth, and a nice web-based interface to look at all the local sensor values, do automations, turn on and off things, check the temp at the beach house, etc.

1. The Sage step:  How to get Sage credentials to publish our MQTT data into the community Sage Beehive

1. Really dreaming:  Do in-situ analysis in the edge node (RPi4 or Nano).  So eventually we would want the full Sage Edge stack to run and process the MQTT data.
