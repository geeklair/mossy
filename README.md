## It's not in the cloud


The overall concept:

1. [How to setup your RPi4](setup-rpi4.md), out of the box, for MQTT in your house.

1. How to hack a Particle.io (as an exemplar) to become an MQTT publisher to your local RPi4

1. [How to set up Home Assistant](setup-hass.md) on your RPi4 so you have a nice web-based interface to look at all the local sensor values, do automations, turn on and off things, check the temp at the beach house, etc.

1. The Sage step:  How to get Sage credentials to publish our MQTT data into the community Sage Beehive

1. Really dreaming:  Do in-situ analysis in the edge node (RPi4 or Nano).  So eventually we would want the full Sage Edge stack to run and process the MQTT data.
